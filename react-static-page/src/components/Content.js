            <p>Once Upon a Time,
            There was a girl named Cinderella, who lived in the outskirts of a kingdom with her Stepmother and two Step Sisters. Though of great beauty and good family, her step family were rotten to the core, and upon Cinderella's father's death, switched up on her something fierce.
            Instead of her being treated as an equal, they put her to work, and probably saved the fortune for upkeep of their house and used it towards Gucci Belts and Louie V purses.
            One day, when the Prince announced to the kingdom that he was having a ball in order to find the lady of his dreams, he invited all the ladies of the kingdom.
            Cinderella being a lady, she was invited. But her Stepmother and sisters told her no and tore her dress and locked her in a storage closet.
            But her mice got her out, and some random fairy who her father cleverly annointed as her godmother, gave her clothes and a stagecoach and turned her mice friends into people.
            Unfortunately the magic only holds till midnight, that's the rules.</p>

            <p>So she went to the ball and had a ball and the prince thought she was real fine so he danced with her.
            But it was midnight, and though the prince thought he'd have her til 2 AM at the very least, chased Cinderella out the castle as she ran away.
            My dude could not find her. But he found her shoe. Well no one should run in heels right.
            But the next day he put his palace guardsto work, he said I want that lady back, so find the lady who's shoe this belongs to.
            Cinderella overheard the news, but once the Stepmother put two and two together, it was back into the closet for Cinderella
            The mice staged a coup and took the key from the Stepmother and freed Cinderella. She tried on the shoe. It fit!
            And the prince, who has his fine lady back, married her, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
            <p>The End.</p>
